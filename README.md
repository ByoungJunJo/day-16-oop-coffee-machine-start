# day16-oop-coffee-machine-start

## 4/14/2021
- Learned about classes and object oriented programming.
- This is a topic that I struggled most back in college.
- Yesterday I built a procedural program where it contains a bunch of codes (if and else statement, etc).
- Then today with the classes and objects, I was able to build a program with much easier to understanding structures.
- That said, in order to create an object from a class:
  ○ Class is like a 붕어빵집 and object is like 붕어빵.
  ○ your_class = YourClass()
  ○ Compare the coffee machine codes from 4/13 (Day 15) vs 4/14 (Day16)
  
It's getting harder now. Now I need to write down what I've been learning each day.
